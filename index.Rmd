## Survey sheds light on the 'crisis' rocking research.

**More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments**, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature*'s survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online qquestionnaire on the reproducibility in research.

### The Survey

In the survey[^2] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibilty in science. Below is the list order by the most highly rated:

*    Better understanding of statistics
*    Better mentoring/supervision
*    More robust design
*    Better teaching
*    More within-lab validation
*    Incentives for better practice
*    Incentives for formal reproduction
*    More external-lab validation
*    More time for mentoring
*    Journals enforcing standards
*    More time checking notebooks
